        <h1>Learning the Command Line, Git, GitHub, and More!</h1>
        <h4>Sunday, December 6th, 2015</h4>
        <p>
            Hello readers! My name is Jon and my first week at Dev Bootcamp (DBC) is quickly winding down. I have learned a lot in only a short period of time and I thought I’d share some of the important takeaways I’ve gleaned thus far in Phase 0. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The week kicked off by learning about a computer’s command line interface (CLI). Most people interact directly with their computer through the graphical user interface (GUI) – the various graphical icons and visual symbols present on a computer (e.g. – folders, files, application icons, etc.) The CLI, on the other hand, is an alternative way to interact with your computer by executing commands in the computer’s command line interpreter (aka terminal), or “shell.” A shell is a user interface (such as bash, a Unix shell and command language, which serves as the default shell on Mac OS X) that grants an individual the ability to interact with an operating system’s services. In other words, the shell is a software program that interprets commands from the user so that a computer’s operating system can perform certain functions. Learning how to navigate the command line is essential in programming efficiently and effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            I devoted the next couple of days to learning about version control, Git, and GitHub. A version control system (VCS) assists with saving something again and again and many times more in order to track changes and manage workflow. A VCS such as Git provides a history of content modifications and helps facilitate collaborative changes to a project. Git is run from the CLI (which I discussed above) and allows you to save different versions of your work and keep track of those changes via “commits,” snapshots of a series of changes made to a project. A message describing the changes is composed so that in the future, a member of a team can refer back to modifications made in the earlier stages of their project. Git lets you create and work on “branches,” or different versions of your project, which you can switch out of interchangeably. GitHub, on the other hand, is run remotely from the Internet. It is a “hub” where programmers can share their code remotely and collaborate on projects simultaneously. GitHub is to Git as Dropbox is to the flashdrive. It is an extremely valuable tool that is used widely among programmers.
        </p>
        <p>
            GitHub is a great place to store code because it helps streamline the process of tweaking and adding to projects. If a mistake is made in the latter stages of a project, it is very easy for a developer to take a couple of steps back and resume the project from the stage where it was operating correctly. Therefore, it is important to develop the habit of committing early and often during the course of a project so that in case you accidentally introduce bugs into your code, you can easily revert back to an earlier, working state while you debug your code. Besides working on your own, personal projects, GitHub allows you to contribute to other people’s projects and vice versa. In other words, GitHub is host of open source software, where individuals can share how a computer program was made and allow anyone to customize the program as they see fit. GitHub’s “open-source” nature cultivates an environment that encourages creativity, innovation, and collaboration among programmers. Open-source software relies heavily on the concept of content licensing, where a developer's code is accompanied by a set of regulations that grant specific permissions for others to use their work. It is a great alternative to simply releasing your work into the public domain or granting permissions on a case-by-case basis.
        </p>

            Hopefully this summary gave you a good sense of what I’ve accomplished in Week 1 of Phase 0. I am excited to move on to Week 2, equipped with the tools and knowledge I’ve gained thus far!
