        <h1>Arrays vs. Hashes</h1>
        <h4>Sunday, January 3rd, 2016</h4>
        <p>
            Hello Readers! This week we got our first taste of programming with Ruby. Ruby, an object-oriented language, represents collections of objects by putting them inside container objects. Two built-in classes dominate the container-object landscape: arrays and hashes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            An array is an ordered, integer-indexed list of objects. Arrays are used to store other objects. The contents of an array always remain in the same order unless you explicitly move objects around (or add/remove them). Arrays can contain virtually any Ruby object, including strings, integers, floats, or even other arrays. <br>
            Syntax of an Array:
            <pre><code>
            array =  ['string', 47, ['I', 'am', 'an', 'array']]
            </code></pre>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            On the other hand, a hash (aka dictionaries or associative arrays) ordered collections of objects (in previous versions of Ruby they were unordered collections). Hashes store objects in pairs, each pair consisting of a key and a value. You retrieve a value by means of the key. Hashes remember the order in which their keys were inserted; thatâ€™s the order in which the hash replays itself for you if you iterate through the pairs in it or print a string representation of it to the screen. NOTE: Keys are unique per hash: you can have only one key/value pair for any given key. <br>
            Syntax of Hash:
            <pre><code>
            state_nicknames = {
                :New York => "The Empire State",
                :Vermont => "The Green Mountain State",
                :Texas => "The Lone Star State"
                :Florida => "The Sunshine State",
                :California => "The Golden State"
            }
            </code></pre>
        </p>
