        <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
        <h4>Sunday, January 17th, 2016</h4>
        <p>
            Hello Readers! This week we spent most of our time refining our knowledge of what are known as Ruby Classes. A class is a convenient bundle of behaviors (aka - methods) that allows you to quickly create many objects that behave essentially the same way. Each of these "objects" that behave similarly are known as "instances" of that class. Frequently used Ruby classes include String, Array, Hash, and Enumerable. 
        <p>
            Classes are defined by using the keyword 'class' followed by a capitalized name (aka - a constant). Constants are used to store information and values that don’t change over the course of a program. This "information" is usually comprised of instance methods and instance variables. "def initialize" is a special method that is executed every time you create a new instance of the class. Initializing an object allows you to establish its own state (saved information). More broadly, instance methods are defined inside a class and are intended for use by all instances of that class. They don’t belong only to one object. Rather, any instance of that class can call an instance method. Instance variables, unlike local variables, help us avoid "hard-coding" values into every object and instead tells different objects that they have different values. In other words, instance variables are to be used within the confines of a class, but can be used among any of the methods created in that class and thus provides flexibility among the possible instances of that class. (NOTE: it is best practice to match the names of instance variables, methods, and arguments.) This may is probably confusing, so let's try an example to sumplement this explanation:
        </p>
        <p>
            Example:
        <pre><code>
            class Car
                def initialize(make, model, year)
                    @make = make
                    @model = model
                    @year = year
                end

                def description
                    puts "This is a #{@year} #{@make} #{@model}"
                end
            end

            old_wheels = Car.new("Ford", "Model-T", 1908)
            old_wheels.description    
            new_wheels = Car.new("Ford", "Fusion", 2016)
            new_wheels.description
        </code></pre>

        <p>
        In this example, I've created a class, "Car". I've initialized the class with three arguments, make, model and year, and then created three instance variables using these three names. I then defined a method, "description", that prints a string that describes a car using the three instance variables defined earlier. This is a simple example, yet it clearly illustrates why Ruby classes are useful - they introduce a sense of flexibility when writing programs. Instances of this class can be used to describe virtually any car.
