How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I really enjoyed wireframing and creating an HTML page with a pair. It was great to bounce ideas off of each other and begin to incorporate some creativity into out blog posts. We actually got so far into it that we created a wireframe for the homepage to our blog as well as a template for what an individual blog might look like.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Wireframing has definitely been helpful in my development process. I am somewhat of a visual learner, so creating a wireframe for my blog posts helped me wrap my head around what my blog will eventually look like. More importantly, though, is that the wireframe provided me with a better sense of how information will flow within my blog, guiding readers along a certain path.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
My pair and I decided that a good wireframe is one which successfully defines the information hierarchy of a website. This makes it much easier for the web designer to plan the layout according to how he/she wants their users to process the information. However, it is difficult to pinpoint what the optimal wireframe looks like because everyone processes information differently, so different formats/layouts might be better suited for different types of people.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
Surprisingly, there weren't any new semantic elements that my pair and I utilized during this challenge.
