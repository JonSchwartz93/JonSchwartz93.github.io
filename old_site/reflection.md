<h1>What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?</h1>
One thing I learned about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge is that deciding which one(s) to use comes with alot of trial and error. Understanding exactly how one CSS selector-property-value combination will affect the webpage requires testing it out to see if it achieves the desired styling.

<h1>What did you learn about CSS positioning?</h1>
Similar to CSS padding, borders, and margin, CSS positioning is also a matter of trial and error. Testing out various scenarios means setting the position of one element in relation to the rest of the webpage and seeing whether or not the desired styling is achieved. 

<h1>What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?</h1>
When considering which aspects of my design were easier or more difficult to implement, I referred to the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM defines the relationship between different elements in a document. Each element can have one parent and many children, and in turn, I used my understanding of these relationships to make changes to individual, or many elements. That being said, in my opinion, the easiest parts of my design to implement were the higher-level elements (e.g. header, nav, footer). These elements serve as the trunk of the tree and encompass the majority of the content present on the page. On the other hand, the most difficult aspects of my design to implement were the more specific elements such as (e.g. h2, p, a, etc.) which are akin to the branches and leaves of the tree.

<h1>What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?</h1>
One important thing that I learned about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge is that it is important to keep the HTML and CSS files and their respective purposes, separate. What I mean is that in my intial version of my HTML file, I had incorporated some minor styling into the code. However, I ended up modifying this once I began incorporating the CSS, My reasoning behind changing this is that CSS can achieve significantly better styling when the HTML is devoted entirely to its role as a semantic language.
