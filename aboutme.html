			<h1>About Me</h1>
			    <p>
			    My name is Jonathan Schwartz and I was born and raised in Chappaqua, New York. I graduated from the University of Michigan in May 2015, with a B.A. in History and a minor in Earth & Environmental Science. During the spring semester of 2014, I had the privilege of studying abroad at King's College London. In April of that semester, I embarked on a month-long Euro-trip with two of my friends, where we traveled to 10 different cities.
			    </p>

			    <p>
			    After graduating from college, I began working at a large financial services firm where success could be achieved almost entirely on an individual basis. Unfortunately, I prefer a team-oriented atmosphere, one in which brainstorming, creativity and collaboration are encouraged. That being said, after less than a year at my first job out of college, I've already made major career change: enrolling in Dev Bootcamp. However, I am confident that the skills acquired at DBC will provide me with the foundational knowledge necessary in joining a web development team.
